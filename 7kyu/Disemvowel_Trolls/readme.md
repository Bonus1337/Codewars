# Vowel Remover (Kata)

## Description

Internet trolls are trying to sabotage our community and we need your help to neutralize their comments. We discovered that the most effective way to mitigate their impact is to remove all vowels from their messages.

Your task is to write a function in TypeScript that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" should become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
