# A Square of Squares

This is a simple program to determine if a given integral number is a square number.

## Task

We are tasked with writing a function that checks if a given number is a square number. In mathematics, a square number, or perfect square, is an integer that is the product of some integer with itself.

## Examples

For example, the numbers `-1`, `0`, `3`, `4`, `25`, and `26` would return the following:

```
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```

## Requirements

1. The function must accept an integer as an input.
2. The function must return a boolean value, where `true` signifies that the number is a perfect square, and `false` means it isn't.
3. The function should work for both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
4. The function should be robust and handle any edge cases, such as negative numbers and zero.
