# Triangle of Consecutive Odd Numbers

This repository contains a solution for calculating the sum of the numbers in the nth row of a triangle made up of consecutive odd numbers.

## Problem Description

Consider the following triangle made up of consecutive odd numbers:

```
             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
```

Our task is to write a program that calculates the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1).

For example:

```
1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8
```
