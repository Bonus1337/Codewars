# Project: Reverse Sequence Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a function `reverseSeq(n: number): number[]` that accepts an integer `n` and returns an array of integers from `n` to 1. The integer `n` must be greater than 0.

For example:

```typescript
console.log(reverseSeq(5));
```

should print out:

```
[5,4,3,2,1]
```

## Requirements

1. Function should accept only one parameter which should be an integer greater than 0.
2. The function should return an array of integers.
3. The first element of the array should be the input number.
4. The last element of the array should be 1.

## Setup

To run this function, ensure that you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.
4. Run the function using Node.js and observe the console output.

## Testing

Tests for this function should be written to ensure that the function behaves as expected. Make sure to cover edge cases and invalid inputs in your test cases.
