# Project Name

## Description

This project contains code that is not executing properly. The main objective of this task is to identify and resolve the issue causing the code to fail.

The code provided includes a `multiply` function defined in the `solution` module, which is imported into the test file. The `multiply` function takes two numbers as arguments and is expected to return their product.

Additionally, the project uses the Jest testing framework to verify the correctness of the `multiply` function. Two test cases have been implemented to check if the function produces the expected results.

## Task

Your task is to identify and fix the issue preventing the code from executing correctly. You should focus on the `multiply` function implementation and ensure that it returns the correct product of the provided numbers.

To assist you in resolving the problem, you can run the test cases using the Jest testing framework. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies and configure Jest properly.

## Testing

This project utilizes Jest as the testing framework. Jest is a powerful and easy-to-use testing library that provides a variety of features for testing JavaScript code.

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm jest index.test.ts
```

The command will execute the test cases defined in the test file and display the results in the terminal.
